** About
   
All these anwsers are written here mainly for the purpose of myself to
understand all things in CLRS in depth. However, anwsers are not guaranteed to
be right. But I would do my best to think twice before written all these anwsers
here.

** Others

There are already some good anwsers, feel free to check them
